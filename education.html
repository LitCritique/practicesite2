<h4> Overview</h4>
I attended Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida from 2003-2007. There, I pursued a double major in English and Secondary Education.

<h4> Academic Highlights</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>English Major:</strong> Focused on literary analysis, critical theory, and research. Dr. Buck, my advisor, encouraged me to explore my curiosities related to the connections between classic and contemporary literature.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secondary Education Major:</strong> Gained hands-on experiences in pedagogy, curriculum design, and classroom management. Interned at Lakeland High School for 2 semesters, one in a self-contained ESOL English class and the second in an AP Literature class. Dr. Watts taught me how to be the educator we all wish we had had when we needed it the most.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Skills Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
   Written and verbal communication 
  <li>
  Lesson planning and instructional design
  </li>
   <li>
 Critical analysis and critical thinking 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Lasting Legacy </h4>
The professors I had at Florida Southern, as well as the tight-knit cohort I learned with, really taught me to love learning and finding the secrets hidden in plain sight. This not only laid the foundation for my love of reading and writing, but helped me to understand, in my teaching profession, that learning has to be enjoyable before it can happen. If I can make learning fun and relevant, students will retain the information and, hopefully, learn to sate their curiosity themselves.

<h4> Overview</h4>
I attended NOVA Southeastern University in Davie, Florida from 2014-2016. I completed the certification and degree requirements to become an Educational Leader with a minor in Business Leadership. <br>
This program equipped me with the knowledge and credentials to be an educational administrator while also broadening my understanding of business management, budgeting, and legal obligations.

<h4> Academic Highlights</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Focused on school administration, leadership theory, educational law, and community outreach and planning. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Skills Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
   School operations and leadership 
  <li>
 Data-driven decision-making
  </li>
   <li>
 Staff development and team building
  </li>
  <li>
 Budgeting and resource management
  </li>
  <li>
Cross-fuctional communication and collaboration with teachers, parents, business partners, and communities.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Lasting Legacy </h4>
This program was recommended to me by principal at the time, and while I used these skills briefly in a leadership role, I quickly found that I wanted to stay in the classroom.  However, this degree helped me understand the behind-the-scenes of education, which gave me a better insight in how to approach specific behaviors, challenges, and ideas within the classroom. Sometimes, just seeing behind the curtain allows us to grow in our own positions, and I've taken this to heart with this degree.

<h4> Overview</h4>
I am currently in my second semester at George Mason University where I am pursuing a Master of Arts in English with a focus on deepening my expertise in literature, critical theory, and academic writing. This program is a continuation of my lifelong passion for English studies and something I am doing for <em>myself</em>

<h4> Academic Focus</h4>

    Advanced literary analysis and research 
  </li>
   <li>
    Contemporary and historical literary theory
  </li>

</ol>

<h4> Future Goals </h4>
I plan to continue my academic journey beyond a Master's degree, with the goal of pursuing doctoral studies in English within the next decade. My long-term vision includes contributing to the field through research, teaching at the collegiate level, and mentoring future educators and scholars.
