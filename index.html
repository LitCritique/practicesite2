      <h2> How Things Are Now </h2>
<p>
I just completed my 16th year in education. I've taught in both public schools and charter schools, and I am currently teaching English 10 and AP Seminar English 10 at <a href= "https://colganhs.pwcs.edu"> Colgan High School.</a> 
</p> 
      <h2> How It All Started </h2>

<p> 
I started teaching middle school English to grades 6-8 Gifted students at <a href="https://denison.polkschoolsfl.com/" target="_blank">Denison Middle School </a> in Winter Haven, Florida. After 8 years at Denison, I moved <a href="https://www.mckeelacademy.com/"target="_blank"> McKeel Academy of Technology, </a> a charter school in Lakeland, where I taught as the only 7th grade English teacher for three years. In 2019, I moved to 9th grade English and 9th grade English Honors.</p>

<p><h3>
      I have taught in several subjects and areas throughout my career, including:</h3></p>

<ul>
  <li>6th, 7th, and 8th grade English</li>
 <li>Journalism and Yearbook</li>
 <li>Video Game Design</li>
 <li>Digital Citizenship</li>
 <li>9th and 10th grade English</li>
 <li>Business and Microsoft Essentials</li>
</ul>
 
    <h2> How I got Here </h2>
<p>After Covid, my husband and I decided we had had enough of Florida. So, we drew a circle around the states we would be interested in moving to, and the states that would offer us reciprocity for our teaching licenses.  While we had several states and areas circled in common, we kept coming back to Virginia. I grew up in the Shenandoah Valley, and I missed the mountains and the seasons; plus, my husband's sister and her family live here, so it really was an opportunity to be closer to loved ones. So, together, we sold our house on <a href="https://6amcity.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a51d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/969x545+1+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-sixam-city.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F35%2F5c%2F1a2da4e13b9a2de80d4c9346484b%2Fadd-a-heading-70.png" target="_blank">Lake Hollingsworth,</a> packed up two kids, two dogs, a cat, and my in-laws, and moved to Stafford, Virginia. In July of 2025, we found our forever home in Prince William County and moved for <small> hopefully </small> the last time. Now, I teach at a high school with a focus on the Creative Fine Arts, my husband teaches video game design at the same school, and our kids love their new schools. I couldn't be happier to be a Virginia Educator. </p>
