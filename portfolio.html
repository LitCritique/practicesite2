<h2>Sway Independent Research Project</h2>
<h4>
  The goal of this project is to empower students to explore a topic of personal or academic interest through a multi-genre research approach. Rather than relying solely on traditional essays, students are encouraged to incorporate creative outlets—such as poetry, visual art, interviews, infographics, or multimedia presentations—to express their understanding and findings.</h4>

<b>This project is designed to:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
  Foster critical thinking by requiring students to evaluate sources for credibility and bias
  <li>
  Develop research skills through the use of citations, annotations, and synthesis of information
   <li>
  Encourage creativity by allowing students to choose how they present their research across multiple genres
 
   <li>
  Promote student voice by giving them ownership over both the topic and the format
  <li>
 Support peer learning by having students teach others about their topic through their final Sway presentation
     </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>Ultimately, this project blends academic rigor with creative expression, helping students become more thoughtful researchers, effective communicators, and engaged learners.</b>

<h2>Identifying Biases</h2>

<h4>
  The goal of this lesson is to help students become more critical readers, writers, and thinkers by learning how to recognize and work through biases—both in the sources they encounter and in their own perspectives.</h4>

<b>This lesson is designed to:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
  Define bias and explain how it can appear in media, literature, research, and everyday communication
  <li>
 Teach students to analyze sources for language, tone, and perspective that may indicate bias
   <li>
 Encourage students to reflect on their own assumptions and how those may influence their understanding of a topic
   <li>
 Provide tools for evaluating credibility and distinguishing between fact, opinion, and misinformation
  <li>
 Foster respectful discussion and open-mindedness when encountering differing viewpoints
     </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>Ultimately, this lesson teaches studetns to focus on identifying bias in text and media, understanding how bias can shape narratives and arguments, and making more informed decisions in research and writing.</b>

<h2>Introducing the Idea of Multiple Perspectives: Hexagonal Thinking & Colonizing Mars</h2>

<h4>
  This introductory lesson uses hexagonal thinking and the provocative question, <em>Should humans colonize Mars?</em>, to immerse AP Seminar students in the heart of the course: complexity, nuance, and gray areas.</h4>

<b>This lesson is designed to:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
 Introduce students to the idea that there are no simple, black-and-white answers in AP Seminar
  <li>
Encourage critical thinking by exploring multiple perspectives—scientific, ethical, economic, environmental, and philosophical
   <li>
Develop a clear line of reasoning that supports their argument or research question
   <li>
Use hexagonal thinking as a visual and collaborative strategy to help students:
<dt> Make connections between ideas
See how different arguments and disciplines intersect
Practice synthesis in a low-stakes, creative way </dt>
     </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p>Each hexagon represents a concept, stakeholder, or argument. As students connect them, they begin to see how ideas interrelate, conflict, or support one another—mirroring the kind of thinking they’ll need for their research and writing throughout the course.</p>

<b>This lesson sets the tone for AP Seminar: students must learn to think outside the box, question assumptions, and embrace ambiguity. It’s not about finding the “right” answer—it’s about exploring the why, how, and what if behind every issue.</b>

<h2>Writing an ACCESS Paragraph</h2>

<h4>
  This lesson is designed to teach AP Seminar students how to write Access Paragraphs—structured, analytical paragraphs that go beyond summary to demonstrate connection, synthesis, and original thinking.</h4>

<b>This lesson is designed to:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
 Connect multiple sources meaningfully, identifying relationships between ideas, perspectives, or arguments
  <li>
Synthesize information by combining insights from different texts to form new, original ideas
   <li>
Develop a clear line of reasoning that supports their argument or research question
   <li>
Practice academic writing that is precise, purposeful, and evidence-based
     </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>Ultimately, This lesson supports the AP Seminar goal of developing independent, critical thinkers who can engage with complex texts and contribute meaningfully to academic conversations.</b>
